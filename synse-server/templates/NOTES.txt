---------------------------------------
Synse Server has been configured with device configurations that override
the default built-in emulator configurations.

Using '-slim' image: {{ if not (contains "-slim" .Values.image.tag) }}OK{{ else }}ERROR

  The '-slim' variant of the Synse Server image is being used but does
  not have the built-in emulator. Custom emulator device configurations
  will NOT be rendered unless a non-slim image is used. Simply removing
  the '-slim' suffix from the tag will give a version with built-in
  emulator.

Emulator enabled:    {{ if has "enable-emulator" .Values.args }}OK{{ else }}ERROR

  The emulator has device configurations, but is not configured to run.
  To run the built-in emulator, add the following in your values.yaml:

    args:
      - enable-emulator
